## PROBLEM DEFINTION
Stormwater and Sewage Spills contain untreated debris directly into the Tijuana River and Imperial Beach affecting pH of the waters affecting marine life and making it more acidic.


## PROPOSED IDEA
A Real-Time Water pH Regulation Network

 - Big idea is pumping in basic solution in untreated water to regulate pH for marine life
 - Starting with pH sensor to determine levels, and pumping basic solution until it’s a regular level


## TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS
If there is polluted water with a more acidic pH, then our device will read the values and add basic solution until the pH is regular/safe for marine life.


## MILESTONES / TIMELINE
1. Completed PCB design on KiCAD and received parts from shipping
2. Assembled PCB with all necessary SMD’s and components and verified successful communication with computer (the device is recognized)
3. Finished 3D printing for basic solution enclosure, path for tube, body for contaminated water and measurement, and plastic cup to gather and pour water (not 3D printed)
4. Completed code for pH sensor data collection and logging to read and display pH values over time for both regular and contaminated water, with pH data collected and tabulated
5. Finished code and hardware integration for pumping with connections to PCB and recognizing pump in Arduino, basic solution can travel in pump to water and stop pumping when correct pH is read. 
6. Testing and data collection in Untreated Water, testing out conditions for demo by recording video of shown, unclean dirty water with higher pH levels and showing pumping solution regulating pH levels until level is sustainable for marine life.
